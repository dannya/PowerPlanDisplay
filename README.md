PowerPlanDisplay
==========

Shows your active Windows powerplan in a window containing all the available powerplans, and allows you to change powerplan with a single click.


## Installation
#### Simple
    npm install --production
    npm start

#### Advanced
    npm install
    gulp release
    npm start

If you perform the "simple" installation and want to make configuration changes, it is advisable to copy the config.js file to config_editable.js and make your changes in the config_editable file, so that your changes aren't lost on upgrade.

The "advanced" installation automatically creates this file for you.
